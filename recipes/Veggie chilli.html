    <h3>This is a really good recipe and  It's pretty easy to make and tastes really good!</h3>
    <p>The easiest chilli you'll ever make, with ready-to-eat grains, kidney beans in chilli sauce and summer veggies - it's 4 of your 5-a-day too!</p>
    <p>My vegetarian chili recipe is filled with the chili essentials: onion, garlic, red bell pepper, pinto and kidney beans, lime, olive oil, salt, and black pepper. I also add corn kernels for a colorful twist. Fresh or frozen corn works equally well, adding pops of yellow and a little crunch.</p>
