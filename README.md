#Recipies project-1
Project Documentation: Recipes Website

1. **Project Overview**:

   This project is a simple website dedicated to sharing recipes. It consists of multiple pages, each featuring a different recipe with details such as ingredients, instructions, and images.

2. **HTML Structure**:

   - The project uses HTML to structure its content.
   - Each recipe is presented on a separate page with a common navigation feature to return to the top of the page and to the main page.

3. **Main Page**:

   - The main page serves as the homepage for the website.
   - It includes a title, an image, and a list of recipe links.
   - Users can click on these links to access individual recipe pages.

4. **Recipe Pages**:

   - There are three recipe pages in the project, each with a unique recipe.
   - Each recipe page follows a consistent structure:
     - Title: The name of the recipe.
     - Image: An image related to the recipe.
     - Description: A brief description or introduction to the recipe.
     - Ingredients: A list of ingredients required for the recipe.
     - Instructions: Step-by-step instructions for preparing the recipe.
     - Navigation Links: Links to return to the top of the page and to the main page.

5. **Images**:

   - The project includes images related to each recipe, enhancing the visual appeal and helping users understand the dish.

6. **Navigation**:

   - The website provides navigation links at the end of each recipe page to return to the top of the page.
   - Additionally, there is a link on each recipe page to return to the main page.

7. **Styling**:

   - While the project lacks extensive styling, it uses inline CSS to control image dimensions for consistency.
   - The pages are simple and functional, focusing on content rather than elaborate design.

8. **Content**:

   - The project showcases three different recipes: "Egg Salad," "Veggie Chilli," and "Indian Chicken Curry (Murgh Kari)."
   - Each recipe page provides comprehensive information, making it easy for users to follow the recipes.

9. **Responsiveness**:

   - The project doesn't explicitly mention responsiveness, so it may require adjustments for optimal display on different devices.

10. **Final Thoughts**:

    - This project is a basic recipe website with a straightforward structure.
    - It can be further improved by adding more styling, responsiveness for different screen sizes, and additional features like a search function or user comments.
    - Overall, it serves as a foundation that can be expanded upon for a more feature-rich recipe sharing platform.
